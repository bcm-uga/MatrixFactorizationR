\title{Indirect effect sizes for latent factor models}
\usage{
effect_size(Y, X, object)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{a response variable matrix with n rows and p columns.
Each column is a response variable (numeric).}

\item{X}{an explanatory variable with n rows and d = 1 column (numeric).}

\item{object}{an object of class \code{lfmm} returned by the \link{lfmm_lasso}
or \link{lfmm_ridge} function.}
}
\value{
a vector of length p containing all effect sizes for the regression
of X on the matrix Y
}
\description{
This function returns 'indirect' effect sizes for the regression of X (of dimension 1) on the matrix Y,
as usually computed in genome-wide association studies.

## Simulation of 1000 genotypes for 100 individuals (y)
u <- matrix(rnorm(300, sd = 1), nrow = 100, ncol = 2) 
v <- matrix(rnorm(3000, sd = 2), nrow = 2, ncol = 1000)
y <- matrix(rbinom(100000, size = 2, 
                  prob = 1/(1 + exp(-0.3*(u\%*\%v 
                  + rnorm(100000, sd = 2))))),
                  nrow = 100,
                  ncol = 1000)

#PCA of genotypes, 3 main axes of variation (K = 2) 
plot(prcomp(y))
  
## Simulation of 1000 phenotypes (x)
## Only the last 10 genotypes have significant effect sizes (b)
b <- matrix(c(rep(0, 990), rep(6000, 10)))
x <- y\%*\%b + rnorm(100, sd = 100)
x <- scale(x, scale = F)

## Compute direct effect sizes using lfmm_ridge
## Note that centering is important (scale = F).
mod <- lfmm_ridge(Y = scale(y, scale = F), 
                  X = x,
                  K = 2)
              
## Compute indirect effect sizes using lfmm_ridge estimates
b.estimates <- effect_size(scale(y, scale = F), x, mod)

## plot the last 30 effect sizes (true values are 0 and 6000)
plot(b.estimates[971:1000])
abline(0, 0)
abline(6000, 0, col = 2)
